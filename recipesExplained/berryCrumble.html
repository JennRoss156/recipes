    <p>What's a recipe website without some desert? This ultimate berry crumble
         recipe may berry well be my favorite summer dessert, with the perfect
        balance of sweet to tart, tender to crisp, and fruit to crumble. I don't
        tack the word ultimate onto just any recipe. Some ice cream on the side
        is highly recommended.</p>

<div class="steps">
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Make crumble: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
             Whisk until thoroughly combined. Grate in frozen butter, stopping occasionally 
             to toss butter into flour mixture until coated.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Stir in egg yolks and vanilla with a fork until egg is mostly absorbed. Add 1 
             teaspoon vinegar; mix briefly. Use your hands to finish mixing, squeezing until 
             clumps form, but mixture remains mostly dry. Add more vinegar if needed. Set crumble
             aside.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Make filling: Combine blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries in another large bowl.
             Add sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, lemon zest, and cayenne pepper. Mix until well 
             combined and sugar and cornstarch are mostly dissolved.</p>
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>Place about 1/2 of the crumble mixture into the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish. Press
             mixture down using a flat cup until well compacted. Spread berry filling on top. Sprinkle 
             remaining crumble mixture over berries, squeezing some of the crumble into clumps.</p>
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until top is beautifully browned and berry filling bubbles, 40 to 45
             minutes. Let cool to room temperature before serving, about 30 minutes.</p>
